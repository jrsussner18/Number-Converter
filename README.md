# Number-Converter

This project is the first program in my Computer Organization and Architecture course at the University of Tampa. It involves taking an input from a text file that contains a number, its given base, the base to convert to, and the number of bits the final number should be. Using object oriented programming, it imports this data into a Number class and outputs the final conversion to another text file. The pdf included in this repository gives more information and is the rubric for this assignment. 



## Reflection

#### What I learned:
- Gained a better understanding of object oriented programming through Java
- Gained an understanding of handling different data types

#### What I could improve on:
- Coding style, this is a early version of my coding abilities. I know that as I progress my coding style will improve. 
- Staying consistent with data types, throughout the code variables are used for their best situation. But it makes the code look a little disorganized.
